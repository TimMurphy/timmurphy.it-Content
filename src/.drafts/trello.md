# Kick starting 2015 with a formalised approach for Trello

My Trello account is a mess. Feels like I have a hundred boards & many I have no idea what they are for. It is time to tame the beast.

## Boards

- Every board has an organisation
- All boards are named `Organisation: Product`
- Business Boards
  - One board per product
  - If a product must have more than one board then it name is `Organisation: Product: *`
- Personal Boards
  - One board per interest

## Lists

Most boards will have the following lists.

- `Inbox` brain dump of ideas
- `Maybe One Day` realistically cards in this list may never be done
- `Backlog` cards that must be completed at some stage
- `Soon` cards that nearly made it to the `Next` list    
- `Next` cards that should be completed this week  
- `Doing` what is being worked on
- `Done` the feel good list :-) Cards I've completed this week

## Planning

Planning is done every Monday morning. See [Monday Planning](https://trello.com/c/BNeksdeZ).
