VA rating always being equal to or larger than the Watt rating

UPS have both maximum Watt ratings and maximum VA ratings. **Neither the Watt nor the VA rating of a UPS may be exceeded**.

It is a de-facto standard in the industry that the Watt rating is approximately 60% of the VA rating for small UPS systems, this being the typical power factor of common personal computer loads.

The ratio of the Watt to VA rating is called the “Power Factor” and is expressed either as a number (i.e. 0.7) or a percentage (i.e. 70%).

VA = Volts * Amps.

## Arlec Meter

Volts = 240
Amps = 1.20
Watts = 198
Power Factor = 68


## Calculations

VA = 288
Power Factor = 82 (off by 14%, does it matter?)
